# k8s-rbac-tests

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in Kubernetes is a security mechanism, granting or restricting access based on user roles and permissions.  
It ensures a fine-grained approach to safeguard Kubernetes clusters, preventing unauthorized actions.

By testing RBAC policies, you can ensure that only authorized users or service accounts have access to specific resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or actions.
